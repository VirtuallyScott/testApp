└── monitors/            # Synthetic transaction configs
```

## Collections

### Development
- Basic CRUD operations
- Authentication flows
- Error scenarios
- Rate limiting tests

### Staging/Production
- Smoke tests
- Critical path monitoring
- Performance checks
- Health checks

## Synthetic Monitoring

Collections configured for continuous API monitoring:
- Availability checks
- Response time monitoring
- Error rate tracking
- SLA compliance checks

## Usage

1. Import collections into Postman
2. Set up environment variables
3. Run collections manually or via Newman CLI
4. Configure monitors for synthetic transactions

## Running Tests via Newman

```bash
newman run collection.json -e environment.json
```

## TODO

- [ ] Create initial API collections
- [ ] Set up environment configurations
- [ ] Configure synthetic monitors
- [ ] Add performance test scenarios
- [ ] Document test cases
