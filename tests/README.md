# Test-Driven Development (TDD) Suite

This directory contains test suites following TDD principles for our three-tier application.

## Structure

```
tests/
├── unit/           # Unit tests for individual components
├── integration/    # Integration tests between components
└── e2e/            # End-to-end tests for full application flows
```

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests
- API endpoint handlers
- Database models
- Business logic
- React components
- Redux actions/reducers

### Integration Tests
- API-Database interactions
- API-Redis interactions
- Frontend-API communications
- Cache operations

### End-to-End Tests
- Complete user journeys
- Cross-component workflows
- Performance tests
- Load tests

## Running Tests

Each component has its specific test runner:

- Backend (Python): pytest
- Frontend (React): Jest
- E2E: Cypress
- API Testing: Postman/Newman

## TDD Workflow

1. Write failing test
2. Implement minimum code to pass
3. Refactor while keeping tests green
4. Repeat

## TODO

- [ ] Set up pytest configuration
- [ ] Set up Jest configuration
- [ ] Set up Cypress
- [ ] Create initial test templates
- [ ] Configure test coverage reporting
